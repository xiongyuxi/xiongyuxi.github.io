Recently, my old wordpress blog host on AWS EC2 became very unreliable. Either the connection time out or super slow loading speed. One of my client who has a AWS EC2 wordpress blog face this same issue. Therefore, I decide to move the old blog to github page. Although need pay more effort, hope the new blog will be fast and reliable.
