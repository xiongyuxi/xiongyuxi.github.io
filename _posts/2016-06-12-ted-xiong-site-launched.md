I use wordpress to host my personal website for years. However, the wordpress server I hosted on AWS EC2 server became unreliable recently and it is very costly and diffcult to fix that issue without prefessional AWS developer account. Consider my personal website is not heavy in content, I decide to move the whole site to github page. It was powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown printable [cheatsheet](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf)  to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought, but it require more tech experience to build.
